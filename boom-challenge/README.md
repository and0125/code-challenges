# Boom Challenge

set up a function that accepts a number between 0 and 100 as a starting point, and for every number that is a multiple of 7 and includes 7 as one digit, it replaces the number with the word 'boom'.

three stages to the answer:

1) answer the question as asked
2) answer the question as asked without changing the data type of the numbers
3) answer the question so that it scales correctly (i.e. if 100 was 1,000)
